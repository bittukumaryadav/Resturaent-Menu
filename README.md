# Resturaent-Menu
In these to create Resturant Menunwe use React js,HTML,CSS,API.And we use visual Code Editior platform to create these.
Through Html we crate a page to respond it,and by css we gave the esign to navbar and card where we saw all the food item.
Through App.js we run and import all the other things we needed.

We use menuApi.js for creat a link of all food data,category,price,description and images.
We use Menucard for create a card where we show all the food item.
We create Resturant.js were we create all the possible list and data about food and navbar.

we also create seperate navbar and import iin Resturant.js becuse it cause messy to write a same code regular so we create a seperate navbar and there we create a list and array and also 
use loop to recall it according to our requirement.

We also use curElem it's mean in these we store all data of navbar and card item(like-food name,description,price,etc),
and use it according to our requirement.


THANK YOU.
